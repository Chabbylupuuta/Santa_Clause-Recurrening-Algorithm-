Santa's Workshop in C++
Ho ho ho! It's that time of year again and Santa's workshop is bustling with activity! In this C++ program, we simulate Santa and his elves preparing for Christmas, and even going on vacation!

Approach
The program starts with 6 elves working on some toys. After a short while, each elf needs help from Santa. When 3 elves need help, Santa wakes up and helps them. Once Santa has helped the elves, he goes back to sleep, but not for long!

While Santa is sleeping, 9 reindeer are returning from their vacations, one by one. When all 9 reindeer have returned, Santa wakes up, gets in his sleigh, and flies over different countries before finally returning to the North Pole and going back to sleep.

Code
The code is simple and straightforward. It uses the C++ 'thread' and 'chrono' libraries to create threads and pause the program for a certain amount of time.
